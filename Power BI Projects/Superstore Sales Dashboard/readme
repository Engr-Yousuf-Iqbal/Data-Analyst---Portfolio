Inventory control and regional marketing strategies rely heavily on sales data insights. 
In this project, I worked with a raw sales dataset, performed thorough data cleaning
and applied data modeling techniques to build an interactive Power BI dashboard.
Key performance metrics were calculated using DAX queries to evaluate sales trends, 
regional performance, and inventory movementâ€”helping drive data-informed decisions for better business planning.
