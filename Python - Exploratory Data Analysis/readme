Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on a large, complex dataset using Python. 
Identified and handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers to prepare the data for analysis. 
Utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate insightful visualizations, 
detect patterns, and uncover relationships. The final output included clean, structured data and clear visual reports
to support further modeling and decision-making.
