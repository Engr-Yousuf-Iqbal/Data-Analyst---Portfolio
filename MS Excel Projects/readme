Developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze a full year of garments sales data.
Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset by removing duplicates, fixing null values, and standardizing entries.
The dashboard includes key metrics like monthly trends, top-selling products, regional performance, 
and customer patterns using PivotTables, slicers, and charts. It offers a clear, visual summary 
for quick and informed business decisions.
